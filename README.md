# Forgotten Kings
## A Forgotten Realms total conversion for Crusader Kings II

### What is this?
The Forgotten Realms began as a creation of Ed Greenwood before becoming a campaign setting for the Dungeons & Dragons tabletop RPG (you know, before you pesky kids got computers and World of Warcraft and such) and has been the setting for a huge number of video games, including Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and Neverwinter Nights as well as Neverwinter Online.

It is the home of Drizzt Do'Urden, everyone's (ahem) favourite elf, and the likes of Minsc (go for the eyes, boo!) and the Sage of Shadowdale, Elminster Aumar.

This mod aims to be a total conversion of Crusader Kings II to the land of Faerûn, just one of the continents on the Realms planet of Toril.

### What's the scope?
There are dozens of sourcebooks and probably hundreds of novels spanning almost 40 years, as well as hundreds of official lore posts from Wizards of the Coast (owners of the D&D franchise), and probably thousands of tidbits from Ed Greenwood and others on the Candlekeep forums. Everything considered canon is eligible for inclusion, provided it fits the CKII mechanics.

The aim is to stay as true to the official material as possible. No invented characters unless they are absolutely necessary.

1st, 2nd and 3rd (and 3.5) editions of D&D kept the lore in check pretty well, but with 4th edition, Wizards kind of screwed the whole thing up, with parallel universes and all kinds of nonsense to justify a retcon that would allow huge changes to the map. Obviously CKII does not support drastically changing the map depending on the year, and the vast majority of source material relates to editions 1-3.5, so this is where the mod will be aimed.

### What's done so far?
I have very deliberately taken a conservative approach. My aim is to flesh out one area of the huge map as much as possible and make it as playable as possible before starting on others. To that end, the Kingdom of Cormyr is my starting point.

It's very playable so far but not a very fun experience yet because there's a lack of things to do and conquer.

Areas that are in so far (none of these are fully fleshed out):
* Calimshan
* Cormyr
* Dalelands
* Moonshae Isles
* Sembia
* Tethyr

### How do I play?
It's important to realise that this repository *does not* contain all the files required to play. This is because there are several large bitmaps that are not suitable for a github repository. Use the download links below, which contain everything from this repository, plus the large images needed.

At the moment, please ensure all DLC except Sword of Islam is disabled, because the mod is not compatible with certain DLCs for now. I have not tested its compatibility with other mods, so you probably want to disable every other mod while loading this.

Only Cormyr is fleshed out and only during the 1300s, so it might be an idea to pick a custom start and set the year to something in the 1300s.

### Can I be Drizzt Do'Urden?
No. Just no. ;) In seriousness, I'm not aware of him holding any landed titles that would be included in the mod.

### Can I help?
Yes, volunteers would be very much appreciated. You are welcome to fork this repository and make pull requests so they can be included. I realise this means you will need to be familiar with git in order to submit changes, but I feel this is the best way of keeping track of the thousands of files required to make a total conversion.

For most aspects of the mod you will need to be familiar with the source material as the aim is to create the most canon version of the Realms that is possible within the game. I would reject any pull request that contains non-canon material unless it's vital (such as a father for two characters listed as brothers, so that the game can recognise them as brothers).

I realise that the number of people with git knowledge, CKII modding experience, and knowledge of the Forgotten Realms lore, who are also keen to help, is going to be absolutely tiny.

Even if you can't or don't want to contribute, playtesters are welcome to give feedback and suggestions. I am not an experienced modder for CKII so I have a lot to learn.
