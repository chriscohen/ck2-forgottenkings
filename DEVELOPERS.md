## Getting set up

You'll need to go through a few steps to get set up.
1. Make sure you have an account on github.
2. You can either fork this repo, or apply to collaborate directly on it.
   * You should fork the repo if you've never worked on it before.
   * If you've made a few pull requests with useful changes, you might want to ask to collaborate.
3. Install some form of git on your computer. The easiest way (if on Windows) is just to [get Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) but you can use anything that works with git.
4. It's best to move your other mods out of the way so they don't affect the git process. Back up the contents of your **My Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings II\mod** folder somewhere.
5. The repo does not contain large binary files, like maps and loading screens. You should download the latest released version of the mod for these. See **README.md** for a download link. 
6. Clone your forked repo (or the base repo if you have collaborator access) somewhere temporary.
7. Ensure you have "show hidden files" switched on in Windows (or whatever OS you're using).
8. Move the stuff you've just cloned into **My Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings II\mod**
   * Overwrite what is already there.
   * You should end up with a **ForgottenRealms.mod** file, a **.gitignore** file, and a **ForgottenRealms** folder, along with some **.md** files.
9. You are now set up to work on the mod.
